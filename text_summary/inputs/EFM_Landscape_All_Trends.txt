Cyber fraud fusion – Organizations are moving to shared technology services models to improve collaboration and information sharing between cyber, fraud and AML teams. This will lead to technology consolidation and corporate realignment.
AI – This is a twofold trend relevant to both fraudsters and fraud management practitioners. For fraudsters, AI is already being used to improve effectiveness of attacks on many fronts (e.g. the use of deepfakes and large language models to create convincing and personalized scams) and will become more scalable over the next 2-3 years. For fraud practitioners, the use of AI algorithms, such as supervised and unsupervised machine learning and deep learning models, will continue to challenge and/or replace legacy rules-based systems.
Scams – Legacy EFM controls are not equipped to address authorized payment scams which require a new era of technologies to address (e.g. Confirmation of Payee, behavioral biometrics). In addition, regulators around the globe are starting to recognize scams as a new class of fraud putting more liability on receiving banks, telcos and social media platforms (see Potential Disruptors).
The growth in instant real time payments and the desire to reduce friction is forcing FIs to deploy anti-fraud solutions at a much larger scale than before and covering more channels than just the card payments.
Use of AI and Machine learning (extended data analytics and pattern recognition, real-time predictive models, unsupervised adaptive models, behavior analysis).
Scalability and adaptability of deployment.
More frequent and stringent regulatory requirements and updates.
Biometrics and authentication (with focus on digital channels).
Collaboration and threat intelligence.
More intelligence to reduce false positives.
More artificial intelligence aided insights and automation for faster investigations"
Expanding beyond traditional self-service tools, the ability for systems to identify intricate fraud patterns and provide actionable insights will empower users with enhanced decision-making capabilities that leverage sophisticated analytics to detect and counteract emerging threats swiftly.
The move towards offering comprehensive services that oversee the entire lifecycle of fraud detection models, including the development, deployment and real-time optimization based on evolving market conditions and fraud trends.
One pivotal trend is the introduction of anonymized cross industry data at scale to existing PII and risk signal environments to establish linkages and holistically understand an individual and the consistency with which their information is used, operationalizing fraud models fast enough to compliantly address constantly changing fraud typologies. This visibility into the signals that other organizations are identifying, which has historically been a significant challenge, enables financial institutions to manipulate expanded data to identify potential new signals and understand how existing systems perform against those signals to determine how a new signal (such as a potentially emerging fraud typology) impacts an existing portfolio.
Move to cloud deployment.
Prevalence of scams.
Increased need for model explainability and governance.
GenAI.
The growthn real-time payments.
Criminals adapt quickly and operate across different channels, so it’s critical for Financial Institutions to set up omnichannel models and rules that are self-service, tested against production data and implemented quickly.
FI’s increasing use of 3DS.
Banks moving to prevention rather than detection.
There has been a significant growth in Scams across the payments landscape in all global markets. domestic regulators are examining liability and, in some situations, demanding Banks to be more responsible for refunding victims. Synthetic, Identity and Application Fraud continue to represent challenges as increasing growth in digital originations. There has been increased focus on preventing and detecting mule accounts which receive the funds from scams and other frauds. Companies have been investing in data science and we are seeing more customers interested in executing their own models alongside vendor-built models. Finally, there is an ever-increasing amount of third-party intelligence that requires banks to be nimble in orchestrating while having the ability to manage a growing number of APIs.
GenAI is the most recent driver of 50%+ increases in fraud rates in that it enables bad actors to commit fraud more convincingly and at scale.  Also with increased regulatory pressures in most geographies, financial services companies will likely place more attention on this issue or face increasing losses and fines.
Increasing interest in new account fraud (fake accounts).
Implementing anti-fraud solutions earlier in the chain, e.g., intervening before getting to the point of attempted card fraud or stopping account registration for fake accounts before incurring the associated KYC and IDV costs. 
Customers are increasingly concerned with the costs associated with having developers modify their applications to call APIs and to take action on fraud scoring. They are increasingly looking for integration that does not require R&D resources and for orchestration solutions to call custom actions. 
Customers are also looking towards a holistic viewpoint of the entire customer journey through their site and the associated risk, as well as visualizations of clusters and fraud rings. 
One of the biggest trends that will only accelerate in the fast-evolving landscape of 2024 is the proliferation of accessible AI. With threat actors gaining cost-effective access to various AI tools, launching cyber attacks and committing digital fraud is becoming extremely cheap. Launching a misinformation campaign to create an army of fake personas or fake accounts has never been cheaper, and adversaries will continue taking advantage of these technologies.
Consolidation and Integration of Fraud solutions with Security and Identity risk solutions.
Response Automation.
Continued increase in account fraud - including account opening and protection/management.
Synthetic IDs remain problematic.
Solutioning for RTP transaction fraud and scams.
Biometrics (physical and behavioral).
Creating value by focusing on the end user customer.
There continues to be a merging of platform capabilities as many vendors serving midsize customers are combining fraud management with compliance activities like AML and offering both on the same integration.  Similarly, for customers of all sizes we are seeing a cross over between Risk Based Authentication and EFM.
Combination of many fraud signal sources such as Transaction, Device, session behavior (Behavior Biometrics), cross session behavior, consortium approaches are being offered by leading vendors in this space, via either consolidation or partnerships.
Scams and other advanced use cases are trending higher and becoming more of a concern for customers looking for fraud solutions.
Cost management on staff and replacement with automation.
Evolving Threat Landscape: In the ongoing battle against financial crime, there is a paradigm shift towards addressing increased attack rates, specifically concerning New Account Fraud (NAF) and Account Takeover (ATO). Simultaneously, the landscape is marked by emerging challenges related to scams and mules. Regulatory bodies worldwide are proactively exploring consumer reimbursement models in response to these evolving threats, as exemplified by the impactful UK PSR Announcement in June 2023, which will have mandatory regulatory enforcement for 50/50 reimbursement of consumer scams in the UK market. 
Payments Modernization Dilemma: The momentum toward payments modernization, including the transition to real-time payments and the advent of open banking, is a double-edged sword. While these advancements offer unparalleled convenience, they also attract sophisticated fraudsters. Consequently, the demand for sophisticated fraud controls becomes imperative to safeguard against evolving fraud methodologies. Payment rail updates to the ISO 20022 scheme by 2025 is top of mind.
Precision through Machine Learning: The strategic implementation of Machine Learning (ML) models is pivotal in achieving the pinnacle of fraud detection efficiency. Striking the delicate balance between high detection rates, minimal false positives, and preserving a seamless customer experience is the new standard. Leveraging ML becomes not just a strategy but a fundamental necessity in the fight against financial fraud.
Explainability with ML/AI:As Financial Services navigate complex, highly regulated environments, there is a growing emphasis on Machine Learning explainability and model governance. Operationalizing ML requires transparency and accountability. Therefore, focusing on these aspects ensures that ML becomes a valuable asset rather than a potential risk in the regulated financial landscape.
Cloud-First Innovation: The future of technological investments is unequivocally aligned with a ""Cloud First"" strategy. This strategic shift is not merely an investment but a proactive stance to drive innovation in cloud solutions. With a targeted focus on enhancing speed, flexibility, and scalability, the cloud-first approach ensures financial institutions stay agile in an ever-evolving landscape.
Overcoming Data Integration Challenges: The proliferation of point solutions and diverse data sources poses a significant challenge in achieving effective end-to-end fraud management. Recognizing this, the focus now shifts to innovative approaches for data acquisition and integration. Solutions that address this challenge head-on are pivotal for holistic and comprehensive fraud management strategies.
Generative AI and Criminals: While Generative AI serves as a catalyst for advancements, it raises concerns about potential threats. Anticipate a surge in fraudulent activities facilitated by deep fakes, voice cloning, and manipulations of photos, as fraudsters increasingly harness the power of generative AI. cutting-edge tools, this will amplify the need for more sophisticated security measures
The increase in scams and APP fraud is challenging traditional EFM tools
Emerging regulations and fraud liability for scams / APP fraud are driving buyers to invest in scams/ APP detection. 
Real-time payments adoption in different shapes and forms and the associated fraud that becomes almost irreversible drives buyers to seek for efficient fraud mitigation tools for these payment options.
Blurring lines between Fraud Prevention/ Authentication/ Consumer Identity.
Convergence of auth strategy across different LOB and channels.
More emphasis on machine learning and less emphasis on manual rules.
The increased use of AI both for committing and better preventing fraud. Fraudsters are using AI to improve their attacks, while counter-fraud toopls are using AI to better catch and stop cybercriminals.
The expansion of IAM solutions to include fraud protection and/or the expansion of fraud solutions to include IAM capabilities. In general we’re seeing a convergence between fraud and identity tools, which makes sense as they work better together.
The role of identity teams in counter-fraud initiatives is expanding, due to the fact that identity is often a key gateway to fraud. Many types of fraud only become possible when an identity has been compromised, whether it is when ATO has occurred or when a stolen identity is used to register for a new account or service. Identity teams are taking a more active role in evaluating and designing an appropriate counter-fraud response.
An increased focus on social engineering and scams. This links back to the AI point from earlier – generative AI has made it much easier to make very believable scam emails and scripts which can lead to compromised credentials, stolen identities, and ultimately financial loss. 
Understanding the anomalies within the order processing flow to help identify fraud trends. The more granular you become in understanding your customers, the faster you can react to emerging fraud trends. Constant analysis of your incoming fraud chargebacks and comparing that to your incoming orders will help you manage losses going forward. It will also help identify opportunities in rule construction and the manual review process. Fostering a culture of vigilance and perfect execution between your Client success, payments, and fraud team. Having an understanding of converting more good orders vs. canceling or blocking good customers from transacting. Striking the best balance between systematic decisions (pass/fail) with low manual review rates.
Increase in network and centralized scores. 
How will generative AI impact fraud management from both the ability to commit fraud to the ability to fight AI-generated fraud schemes; the desire to to adopt fully integrated end-to-end solutions that cover detection through investigation; build vs. buy for fraud management solutions
AI-driven fraud and solutions.
Convergence of Fraud and Cybersecurity within the enterprise.
The democratization of fraud - the accessibility and marketability of tools to commit fraud. For example, openly available forums on Telegram provide a range of fraud-as-a-service tools as well as stolen credentials.
These responses are given in relation to our specific target market: tier 1-3 Financial Institutions 
Faster and Instant Payments driving innovation from fraudsters as well as speed and data volume challenges 
Increased regulatory interest in fraud, where historically fraud investment has been driven by internal bottom-line considerations in FIs. 
The use of behavioral biometrics, such as keystroke dynamics and mouse movement patterns, adds an additional layer of authentication and fraud detection, making it harder for fraudsters to mimic user behavior.
