"•	Cyber fraud fusion – Organizations are moving to shared technology services models to improve collaboration and information sharing between cyber, fraud and AML teams. This will lead to technology consolidation and corporate realignment.
•	AI – This is a twofold trend relevant to both fraudsters and fraud management practitioners. For fraudsters, AI is already being used to improve effectiveness of attacks on many fronts (e.g. the use of deepfakes and large language models to create convincing and personalized scams) and will become more scalable over the next 2-3 years. For fraud practitioners, the use of AI algorithms, such as supervised and unsupervised machine learning and deep learning models, will continue to challenge and/or replace legacy rules-based systems.
•	Scams – Legacy EFM controls are not equipped to address authorized payment scams which require a new era of technologies to address (e.g. Confirmation of Payee, behavioral biometrics). In addition, regulators around the globe are starting to recognize scams as a new class of fraud putting more liability on receiving banks, telcos and social media platforms (see Potential Disruptors).
"	"1.	Organizational misalignment. Messaging of the reality of fraud and fraud management isn’t making it up to C-suite, and executives don’t understand the problem well enough. Organizations continue to increase loss budgets instead of investing in fraud detection and prevention technology.
2.	Budget prioritization. Often, the people who hold the budget for EFM projects prioritize investments to initiatives aligned to revenue generation, not loss prevention.
3.	Crowded industry. Too many fraud management vendors with different value propositions and overpromising on capabilities makes it difficult for buyers to differentiate among solutions.
"	One of the biggest potential disruptors in this market will be the direction regulators around the world take as it pertains to legislation and policy centered around scam reimbursement and the role of receiving banks, telcos, and internet platforms. While the UK is the country furthest ahead in terms of enacting law, other countries are following suit with their own variation of requirements. Many regulators are putting out language that centers around liability shifts for scam reimbursement on receiving banks. This creates new challenges for FIs to rethink receiving side controls to prevent money laundering and mule accounts. Some regulators (Australia and Singapore are recent examples) have also proposed extending liability to telcos, internet platforms and social media companies. In Brazil, Resolution 6 is mandating data sharing between banks which will include the details of the target account and the name of the account holder if the fraud involves the transfer or payment of funds.
The growth in instant real time payments and the desire to reduce friction is forcing FIs to deploy anti-fraud solutions at a much larger scale than before and covering more channels than just the card payments.	Time taken to deploy the solution can be long as AI/ML model development on historic data takes a long time. 	N/A

The move towards offering comprehensive services that oversee the entire lifecycle of fraud detection models, including the development, deployment and real-time optimization based on evolving market conditions and fraud trends.

One pivotal trend is the introduction of anonymized cross industry data at scale to existing PII and risk signal environments to establish linkages and holistically understand an individual and the consistency with which their information is used, operationalizing fraud models fast enough to compliantly address constantly changing fraud typologies. This visibility into the signals that other organizations are identifying, which has historically been a significant challenge, enables financial institutions to manipulate expanded data to identify potential new signals and understand how existing systems perform against those signals to determine how a new signal (such as a potentially emerging fraud typology) impacts an existing portfolio.
"	"The rise of real-time payments and the associated increase in the attack surface presents new challenges in fraud prevention, necessitating a shift towards more agile, real-time fraud detection methods. Banks are also grappling with the complexities of synthetic identity fraud and the vulnerabilities in physical biometrics authentication, underscoring the need for robust, multi-layered fraud detection and authentication strategies. 

Another expected increase is in synthetic ID fraud, stemming from stolen or fabricated personal information. It’s difficult to detect, causes significant losses and it becomes more complex by the lack of consistent tracking of synthetic identity fraud.
"	"GenAI and its implications: AI decision-makers are already evolving their AI governance programs to address GenAI use cases, such as the growing use of AI development assistants for code generation and productivity enhancement. However, this is accompanied by security risks and concerns. 

Synthetic data will unlock opportunities currently restricted by regulatory requirements and complexities. This is because synthetic data can help overcome challenges with personal data, such as collecting and cleansing data (which is difficult for many organizations). Synthetic data is also emerging as a key tool to mitigate privacy and ethical challenges, as it is not directly linked to individuals. It increases the ability to process personal data for AI, GenAI, and analytics without privacy-related limitations. This is crucial because large volumes of high-quality data are necessary for AI training and analytics; and combined with security controls and agreements, synthetic data facilitates safer and more valuable data sharing.

Gen AI is the most recent driver of 50%+ increases in fraud rates in that it enables bad actors to commit fraud more convincingly and at scale.  Also with increased regulatory pressures in most geographies, financial services companies will likely place more attention on this issue or face increasing losses and fines.	The market is complex and understanding how each vendor might perform is very challenging. To counter this, we encourage the buyer conducts a proof-of-value in which we build a custom deep learning model on their sample data, and then can detail exactly how much we would be able to save them in terms of fraud and compliance automation.   In addition, we offer an ROI guarantee, ensuring that the vast majority of the value we generate accrues to the client and their respective customers.	New technologies such as Gen AI can help manage some of the nuances in the data, but fraudsters are far ahead of financial services companies, so we don't see an end to the rapid growth of fraud committed against organizations.
"Increasing interest in new account fraud (fake accounts)
Implementing anti-fraud solutions earlier in the chain, e.g., intervening before getting to the point of attempted card fraud or stopping account registration for fake accounts before incurring the associated KYC and IDV costs. 
Customers are increasingly concerned with the costs associated with having developers modify their applications to call APIs and to take action on fraud scoring. They are increasingly looking for integration that does not require R&D resources and for orchestration solutions to call custom actions. 
Customers are also looking towards a holistic viewpoint of the entire customer journey through their site and the associated risk, as well as visualizations of clusters and fraud rings. 

One of the biggest trends that will only accelerate in the fast-evolving landscape of 2024 is the proliferation of accessible AI. With threat actors gaining cost-effective access to various AI tools, launching cyber attacks and committing digital fraud is becoming extremely cheap. Launching a misinformation campaign to create an army of fake personas or fake accounts has never been cheaper, and adversaries will continue taking advantage of these technologies.

"•	Evolving Threat Landscape: In the ongoing battle against financial crime, there is a paradigm shift towards addressing increased attack rates, specifically concerning New Account Fraud (NAF) and Account Takeover (ATO). Simultaneously, the landscape is marked by emerging challenges related to scams and mules. Regulatory bodies worldwide are proactively exploring consumer reimbursement models in response to these evolving threats, as exemplified by the impactful UK PSR Announcement in June 2023, which will have mandatory regulatory enforcement for 50/50 reimbursement of consumer scams in the UK market. 

•	Payments Modernization Dilemma: The momentum toward payments modernization, including the transition to real-time payments and the advent of open banking, is a double-edged sword. While these advancements offer unparalleled convenience, they also attract sophisticated fraudsters. Consequently, the demand for sophisticated fraud controls becomes imperative to safeguard against evolving fraud methodologies. Payment rail updates to the ISO 20022 scheme by 2025 is top of mind.

•	Precision through Machine Learning: The strategic implementation of Machine Learning (ML) models is pivotal in achieving the pinnacle of fraud detection efficiency. Striking the delicate balance between high detection rates, minimal false positives, and preserving a seamless customer experience is the new standard. Leveraging ML becomes not just a strategy but a fundamental necessity in the fight against financial fraud.

•	Explainability with ML/AI:As Financial Services navigate complex, highly regulated environments, there is a growing emphasis on Machine Learning explainability and model governance. Operationalizing ML requires transparency and accountability. Therefore, focusing on these aspects ensures that ML becomes a valuable asset rather than a potential risk in the regulated financial landscape.

2. The expansion of IAM solutions to include fraud protection and/or the expansion of fraud solutions to include IAM capabilities. In general we’re seeing a convergence between fraud and identity tools, which makes sense as they work better together.
3. The role of identity teams in counter-fraud initiatives is expanding, due to the fact that identity is often a key gateway to fraud. Many types of fraud only become possible when an identity has been compromised, whether it is when ATO has occurred or when a stolen identity is used to register for a new account or service. Identity teams are taking a more active role in evaluating and designing an appropriate counter-fraud response.
